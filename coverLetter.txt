Dear Manager, 

It is with great joy that I apply for the position of intern at your company. It is indeed true that I lack work 
experience in the domain of web development but, this has never been a source of demotivation to me. I have been working 
for HTML, CSS, REACT, BOOTSTRAP and GIT for close to a year now and I believe the few projects I have accomplished have given me a
certain skill level.

I am a very sharp ,hardworking, curious, fun and respectful person. I have the knack for leadership (sadly have no proof), 
but I am ready for any test to prove my worth. My communication skills are very good for I see it as beneficial to exchange knowledge 
with those around us, in order to share idea and grow as a whole.

Equally, I am very open minded. I love integrating ideas, making discoveries, trying out new things etc. I believe that through
this internship program, I will be able to hone my skills, help the company by working in projects and get a reasonable amount of work experience.
Thank you for your kind attention, I look forward to working with you.

Yours sincerely, 

Frank Jordan.
